# Plotly-data-visualization
I performed a few visualization techniques using the Plotly library on a dataset. 
Visualization is an important aspect of Data Science where we explore the sample and draw some conclusions on it. 
As numbers may not show us hidden patterns but visualization catches everything. 
I performed on 1. Line plot 2. Scatter plot 3. Bar plot 4. Box plot 5. Histogram 6. Surface plot 7. Bubble plot
